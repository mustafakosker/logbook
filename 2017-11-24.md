## Consider the problem youâ€™re attempting to solve
  - Navigate to the person on the map by clicking person link on another page

## Describe your method for solving it
  - Load person/data related to map before loading the page

## Describe the process of carrying out the method
  - Check the method that zooms into the person and and where it is located

## Record what happened, and ask how it could be improved
  - Person is fetched, state is updated and componentDidMount method is called. However
  the mapbox is not loaded yet, and is not able to zoom in to the person. Simply fetch 
  the person before loading the map or add a callback to map onload function to zoom into
  the person.

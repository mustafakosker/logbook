### Consider the problem youâ€™re attempting to solve
  - Send base64 encoded and signed xml to backend

### Describe your method for solving it
  - Copied and pasted xml in IDEs causes to xml to be formatted automatically. Use command line to create file instad. `pbpaste > signed-saml.xml` . base64 encode file using nodejs. `Buffer.from(file).toString('base64')`.

### Describe the process of carrying out the method
  - Sent the original xml encoded by the website base64decode.org via Paw. It worked. Tested it using nodejs and it did not work in the first run. Debugged the backend and taken the base64 decoded xml and pasted it to see if they're the same. Realised that some of the whitespaces has been added and removed by ide.

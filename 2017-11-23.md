### Consider the problem youâ€™re attempting to solve
  - Send a certificate file to backend with newline characters at the end. Otherwise
  it can not be parsed on the backend side.

### Describe your method for solving it
  - Used `<textarea />` and did not work, `white-space: pre-wrap` did not work as well.
  Read the file on the client side and sent it as a string and it worked.
```
const onCertificateFileChange = (event, setFileContents) => {
  const file = event.target.files[0];
  const reader = new FileReader();

  reader.onload = (evt) => setFileContents(evt.target.result);
  reader.readAsText(file, 'UTF-8');
};
```

### Describe the process of carrying out the method
  - Tried sending file to backend directly at first, but since the request already is expected
in JSON format it was not possible to change `Content-Type` of the request. So used this method
instead, since the input file will be very small.

### Record what happened, and ask how it could be improved
  - Use loading indicator when the file is being loaded with javascript. Use certificate validator.
